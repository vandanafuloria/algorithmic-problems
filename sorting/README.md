# Sorting

Sorting means arranging elements in a specific order, typically in increasing or decreasing order. There are many sorting techniques used to organize elements in an array.

# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It's easy to understand and explain.

## Approach: Increasing Order

The basic idea is to repeatedly compare adjacent elements in the array and swap them if they are in the wrong orderâ€”specifically, if the left element is larger than the right one. This way, larger elements "bubble" toward the end of the array.

- We repeat this process for all elements, but we can optimize it:

- After each full pass through the array, the largest unsorted element will be in its correct position.

- Therefore, we can reduce the number of comparisons in subsequent passes.

- Additionally, we can check if any swaps occurred during a pass.

- If no swaps happen, it means the array is already sorted, and we can terminate early.

- This makes the algorithm more efficient in cases where the array is already sorted or nearly sorted.

## ðŸ‘‡ Disadvantages : Time complexity

- It is not suitable for large sized data.
- In average case and worst case time complexity is O(n2)

## Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted portion of the array.

## Concept

The array is conceptually divided into two parts:

1.  A sorted portion (initially containing only the first element).

2.  An unsorted portion (the rest of the array).

- Starting from the second element, each item from the unsorted portion is compared with elements in the sorted portion.

- It is then inserted into its correct position by shifting larger elements to the right.

- This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

## Key points

- The first element is always considered sorted.

- For each element in the unsorted part:

- Compare it with the elements in the sorted part, moving from right to left.

- Shift elements to the right if they are larger than the current element.

- Insert the current element at the correct position.

- This results in the array being built up in a sorted manner, one element at a time.

## ðŸ‘‡ Disadvantage : Time complexity

- In best case : when list is sorted already O(n)
- like bubble sort it has also O(n2) time complexity in average and worst case.
