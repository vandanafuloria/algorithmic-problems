# Sorting

Sorting means arranging elements in a specific order, typically in increasing or decreasing order. There are many sorting techniques used to organize elements in an array.

# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It's easy to understand and explain.

## Approach: Increasing Order

The basic idea is to repeatedly compare adjacent elements in the array and swap them if they are in the wrong orderâ€”specifically, if the left element is larger than the right one. This way, larger elements "bubble" toward the end of the array.

- We repeat this process for all elements, but we can optimize it:

- After each full pass through the array, the largest unsorted element will be in its correct position.

- Therefore, we can reduce the number of comparisons in subsequent passes.

- Additionally, we can check if any swaps occurred during a pass.

- If no swaps happen, it means the array is already sorted, and we can terminate early.

- This makes the algorithm more efficient in cases where the array is already sorted or nearly sorted.
